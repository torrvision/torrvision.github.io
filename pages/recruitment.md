## [Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Machine Learning x2](https://my.corehr.com/pls/uoxrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.display_form?p_company=10&p_internal_external=E&p_display_in_irish=N&p_process_type=&p_applicant_no=&p_form_profile_detail=&p_display_apply_ind=Y&p_refresh_search=Y&p_recruitment_id=154006)

Grade 7: £33,309 - £35,326 per annum

We are seeking two Postdoctoral Research Assistants in Machine Learning to join Professor Torr’s research group at the Department of Engineering Science (central Oxford). The group is an internationally leading research group that has numerous scientific awards and has close links with some of the top industrial research labs, more information can be found here https://torrvision.com/. The posts are fixed-term for 2 year in the first instance with funding provided by the EPSRC.
 
This is a research project that aims to develop machine learning technologies with applications to computer vision with prime focus towards developing algorithms for reliable, robust, and efficient deep neural networks. We invite applications from candidates with an expertise at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision with a strong emphasis on building algorithms that (1) can learn continually without forgetting; (2) are efficient (for example, parameter pruning or quantization); (3) are empirically robust towards perturbations (adversarial attacks) and reliable (calibrated with reliable uncertainty estimation for out-of-distribution detection); and (4) are provably robust with theoretical guarantees (certified robustness/reasoning about causality). You will be responsible for the development and implementation of novel computer vision and learning algorithms for reliable, robust, and efficient deep neural networks.
 
You should hold a PhD or DPhil (or be near completion of) in Computer Vision or Machine Learning. You should also have excellent communication skills, including the ability to write for publication, present research proposals and results, and represent the
research group at meetings. Strong candidates will also have experience in applying above mentioned algorithms on computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection.
 
Informal enquiries may be addressed to philip.torr@eng.ox.ac.uk.
 
Only applications received before midday on the 15th November 2021 can be considered. You will be required to upload a covering letter/supporting statement, including a brief statement of research interests (describing how past experience and future plans fit with the advertised position), CV and the details of two referees as part of your online application.
