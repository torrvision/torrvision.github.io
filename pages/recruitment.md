## [Departmental Lecturer in Machine Learning](https://my.corehr.com/pls/uoxrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.display_form?p_company=10&p_internal_external=E&p_display_in_irish=N&p_process_type=&p_applicant_no=&p_form_profile_detail=&p_display_apply_ind=Y&p_refresh_search=Y&p_recruitment_id=156460)

We are seeking a full-time Departmental Lecturer in Machine Learning to join the Torr Vision Group at the Department of Engineering Science (central Oxford).  The post is and is fixed-term for 5 years. The Torr Vision Group (TVG) is an internationally leading research lab in computer vision and machine learning. With pioneering works in 3D geometry, image recognition and deep learning, the TVG has made major contributions to the field of computer vision for the past 25 years, and is still heavily innovating today. The aim of the group is to engage in state of the art research into the mathematical theory of computer vision and artificial intelligence, but to keep the mathematical research relevant to the needs of society. By being part of the TVG, the candidate is expected to contribute to the success of the group, by being involved in high-quality and high-impact research and by making core contributions to significant projects, including to the aims of the Turing AI World-Leading Researcher Fellowship.
 
The main research focus of the role is to lead a team of PDRAs and DPhil students within the TVG in developing technologies for reliable and efficient deep neural networks. We invite applications of candidates with strong expertise in developing algorithms for deep neural networks that (1) can learn continually; (2) can provide reliable uncertainty estimates; (3) are robust to perturbations; and (4) are provably robust.  
 
As well as supervising the work of the other team members and managing some of these projects, this job involves helping to develop the long-term vision for reliable and efficient machine learning systems, establishing and answering new research questions and providing both thought and technical leadership.
 
The main teaching focus will be in the field of information engineering, with particular emphasis on machine learning and computer vision.   
 
You should hold a relevant PhD/DPhil, with post qualification research experience in deep learning and computer vision. In particular, we encourage applicants with a strong background in the areas related to efficient, reliable, and robust deep neural networks applied to computer vision tasks. Candidates will also have substantial experience of closely supervising doctoral and masters students, and have shown experience of writing proposals and obtaining research grants.
 
Informal enquiries may be addressed to Prof Philip Torr (philip.torr@eng.ox.ac.uk)
