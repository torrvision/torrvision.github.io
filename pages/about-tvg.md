## What Does the Logo Mean?

The logo was designed when it was the Oxford Brookes group, so it's an **Ox on a Brook**. It has one eye as it needed computer vision. It is also an **Ox on a Ford**. It is also a **Taurus**, in honour of Professor Philippus Torrus.

## What is TVG?

No one knows what it stands for, but here are some suggestions...



- **The Verified Genius** – safety + reasoning vibes.
- **Tensor Volcano Generator** – dangerous, powerful, probably unstable.
- **Totally Valid Guesses** – a.k.a. how LLMs reason.
- **Theory vs. Gravity** – dramatic science crossover.
- **Thinking Very Generally** – broad AI ambition.



- **Turtles, Vortices, Galaxies** – infinite regress, physics, cosmos.
- **Tea, Variables, Gin** – the Oxford lab essentials.
- **The Vibe Gurus** – for when science is a feeling.
- **Thoroughly Vague Gibberish** – what LLMs sometimes output.
- **Toxic Voxel Gremlins** – experimental hazards, do not feed.



- **Too Vision-y, Gone** – farewell to computer vision.
- **Torr's Villainous Gang** – comic-book energy.
- **The Vast Guessers** – nod to scaling laws + LLMs.
- **Thinkers Versus GPUs** – the eternal struggle.
- **Towards Valuable Good** – surprisingly wholesome.



- **Tachyon Violence Generator** – faster than light, slightly illegal.
- **Turbulent Vacuum Goo** – cutting-edge physics, don't touch it.
- **Thermodynamically Very Gross** – entropy always wins.
- **Tyrannical Vector Goblins** – the real reason models misbehave.



- **Totally Vibes-Generated** – no reasoning, only vibes.
- **Token Vomit Generator** – raw LLM realism.
- **Trying Various Gaslights** – safety red-flag, but on-brand.
- **Tragically Very Gaussian** – your model's distribution, always.



- **Tea Versus Gravity** – the real research problem.
- **Tutorials, Vacations, Grants** – the eternal academic cycle.
- **Too Victorian, Guv'nor** – historically accurate AI.
- **Tweed-Vest Gangsters** – sharp fits, sharper maths.



- **Thanos' Variable Gauntlet** – one snap = half the GPUs gone.
- **Twerking Vector Gradients** – convergence, but make it dance.
- **Toad Veneration Guild** – amphibian-aligned intelligence.
- **Totally Venomous Goose** – the new lab mascot.
