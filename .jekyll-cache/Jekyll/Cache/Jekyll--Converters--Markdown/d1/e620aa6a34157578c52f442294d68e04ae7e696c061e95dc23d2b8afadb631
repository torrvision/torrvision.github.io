I"<p>We are always recruiting <strong>Ph.D.</strong> students with strong academic background and solid programming skill. Students who have experiences related to the research topics in our lab are highly preferred.</p>

<p>My research aims at endowing machines with the capability to perceive, understand, and reconstruct the visual world with the following focuses: 1) developing scalable and label-efficient deep learning algorithms for natural and medical image analysis; 2) designing effective techniques for 3D scene understanding and reconstruction; and 3) understanding the behaviors of deep neural networks in handling out-of-distribution data.</p>

<p>If you are interested, please send an email to <a href="mailto:xjqi@eee.hku.hk">xjqi [at] eee.hku.hk</a>. Note that your email title should be formatted as “Affiliation_Name_Program”. For example, if your name is Kevin and you are a student from the University of Hong Kong who intends to apply for the Ph.D. program, then your email title should be “HKU_Kevin_Ph.D.”.</p>
